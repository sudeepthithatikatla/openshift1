Version Control is the practice of managing the changes that happen in a set of files or documents over time.
In software engineering, Version Control Systems (VCS) are applications that store, control, and organize the changes that happen in the source code of an application.
With version control systems, teams can organize and coordinate their work more reliably.
When several developers are working on the same project simultaneously, they must manage changes in a way that avoids overriding others' work, and solve potential conflicts that arise.
Version control systems serve as a centralized, shared, or distributed storage for teams to save their progress.
To coordinate work, teams store their code base in repositories. A repository is a common location within a VCS where teams store their work.
Source code repositories store the project files, as well as the history of all changes made to those files and their related metadata.
Teams can decide to use version control to store and manage the configuration of their platform infrastructure. This practice is known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and is a critical part of building a DevOps culture.
The most popular version control implementation is Git, Other popular version control systems are Mercurial, SVN, and CVS.

Software Version Control

A Version Control System (VCS) enables you to efficiently manage and collaborate on code changes with others. Version control systems provide many benefits, including:

The ability to review and restore old versions of files.
The ability to compare two versions of the same file to identify changes.
A record or log of who made changes at a particular time.
Mechanisms for multiple users to collaboratively modify files, resolve conflicting 
changes,  and merge the changes together.
